            <p>
                The Amazon Clone is a simplified, static replica of the Amazon website bulit using only HTML and CSS.
                This project demonstrates a clean and responsive user interface that mimics key elements of the original platform.
                It include a visually appealing homepage with product sections,a navigation bar for browsing categories,and a foooter
